Hi! I'm a web developer who likes creating helpful tools.
I'm good at react/node and find beauty in dashboards and data.

I got into programming by automating the boring stuff and creating tools and hacks for colleagues in my last non-programming job.

Right now I'm doing something fun by creating a 'Royal Game of Ur' clone. (It's a really fun game! Look for the youtube video by Irving Finkel)

- 2 years of webdev experience (1 year react)
- react / redux / node / js
- I like to keep my HTML semantic and accessible
- CSS / SCSS proficient, though no designer
- curious and interested in learning something new
- self-taught and independent learner / researcher
- humble and companionable teamplayer
